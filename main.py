'''
🧠 Challenge: Data-Driven Turtle Simulation Engine
🏁 Project Goal

Build a command-line program that:

Reads data from a file

Analyzes it using pandas

Makes decisions using algorithms

Visualizes the results using Turtle graphics

This mimics real data workflows:

CLI → Data → Analysis → Decision → Visualization'''
